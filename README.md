React Project - 2 from Udemy - React Practice Course by Coding Revolution

In this project I learnt on:
1. creating routes to navigate inside the SPA. 
2.Then there were some cool animation with the react-reveal, react-move and transitions.
3. Authentication and created an Admin endpoint
4. Adding a sign up email for user to enter. (which I find will be very useful in my own future projects!)
5. Firebase uploads and database on the server to work with. 
6. Deployment of the proejct to Firebase. 

I deployed the website on Firebase: https://m-city-d967a.firebaseapp.com/

Now there were some downside in the project I realised. There were no:
1. Creating an authenticated user from the website. I had to go to the Firebase Authentication to create a user and a password. 
2. There were no button on the home page to get into the sign in page which will lead to the dashbaord. Just click on the link, 
https://m-city-d967a.firebaseapp.com/sign_in

3. If your authenticated then it will lead you to https://m-city-d967a.firebaseapp.com/dashboard
4. Now obviously I am not going to add the password and user details in here. LOL.

Excited to start the next React Project. :D
